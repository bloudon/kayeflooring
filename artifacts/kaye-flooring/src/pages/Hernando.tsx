    name: "Do you install flooring in Hernando County, FL?",
    acceptedAnswer: { text: "Yes. Kaye Flooring Inc regularly installs hardwood, luxury vinyl plank (LVP), and custom stair flooring throughout Hernando County, including Brooksville, Spring Hill, Weeki Wachee, Ridge Manor, and Masaryktown." }
  },
  {
    name: "What type of flooring is best for Spring Hill or Brooksville homes?",
    acceptedAnswer: { text: "Luxury vinyl plank (LVP) is the most popular choice in Hernando County. It is 100% waterproof, handles Florida's high summer humidity without warping or cupping, and stands up to the wear of a busy household. Spring Hill's large residential footprint and the county's growing population make LVP a practical, cost-effective choice. Engineered hardwood is an excellent upgrade for homeowners who want the beauty of real wood in a more dimensionally stable format than solid hardwood." }
  },
  {
    name: "How long does flooring installation take in a Hernando County home?",
    acceptedAnswer: { text: "Single-room installations typically finish in one to two days. Whole-home projects generally run three to five days depending on square footage and the subfloor preparation required. We work efficiently to minimize disruption to your daily routine." }
  },
  {
    name: "Is Kaye Flooring licensed and insured in Florida?",
    acceptedAnswer: { text: "Yes. Kaye Flooring Inc is fully licensed and insured in the state of Florida. Every installation is performed by trained craftsmen under direct owner supervision — not subcontracted crews." }
  },
  {
    name: "Do you offer free estimates in Hernando County?",
    acceptedAnswer: { text: "Yes. We provide free, no-obligation in-home estimates throughout Hernando County. We bring samples to your home so you can evaluate flooring options in your actual space and lighting before making any commitment." }

                  Hernando County sits at an interesting crossroads — close enough to the Tampa Bay metro to attract commuters and remote workers, yet far enough away to offer affordable land, quiet neighborhoods, and the kind of space that has become increasingly rare in South Florida. Spring Hill alone is one of the largest unincorporated communities in the state.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Homes here vary widely — from older 1970s and 1980s block construction in Spring Hill to newer builds in master-planned communities around Brooksville. Many of these homes have original tile or carpet that is well past its prime and significantly undervalues the property. A quality flooring upgrade is one of the most effective improvements an owner can make.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hernando County's climate demands the same respect for humidity and heat that the rest of Central Florida requires. We install LVP and engineered hardwood selected to perform in this environment, not just in a controlled showroom — and we properly prepare every subfloor so the investment lasts.
